Description: Higher-order theorem prover
 LEO-II is a standalone, resolution-based higher-order theorem prover designed for fruitful cooperation with specialist provers for natural fragments of higher-order logic. At present LEO-II can cooperate with TPTP compliant first-order automated theorem provers such as E, SPASS, Gandalf and Vampire.
 . 
 LEO-II was the winner of the THF division (automation of higher-order logic) at CASC-J5. At CASC-23 in 2011, LEO-II finished second in the THF category. LEO-II does also participate in the first-order divisions FOF and CNF. At present LEO-II is the only theorem prover available that supports THF, FOF and CNF syntax.
 . 
 LEO-II is implemented in Objective CAML and its problem representation language is TPTP THF.
