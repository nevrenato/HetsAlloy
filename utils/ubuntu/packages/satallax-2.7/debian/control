Description: Automated theorem prover for higher-order logic
 Satallax is an automated theorem prover for higher-order logic.
 The particular form of higher-order logic supported by Satallax is
 Church's simple type theory with extensionality and choice operators.
 The SAT solver MiniSat is responsible for much of the search for a proof.
 Satallax generates propositional clauses corresponding to rules of a complete
 tableau calculus and calls MiniSat periodically to test satisfiability of
 these clauses. Satallax is implemented in Objective Caml.
