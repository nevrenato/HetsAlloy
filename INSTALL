For compilation we use the Glasgow Haskell Compiler "ghc" Version
ghc-7.4.x, ghc-7.6.x or ghc-7.8.2

The binary "hets" should be produced from a source distribution by:

  make depend
  make hets
  # this takes a while

Missing cabal packages can be installed using utils/installHetsPkgs.sh which
requires the "cabal" binary that is part of the haskell platform
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/.

Use "gmake" (and "gtar" for unpacking) under solaris!

When building hets directly from svn sources, just call "make" and install
further ghc packages if errors occur.

Rather than building the binary yourself, you may try out one of our
nightly created binaries (compressed with bzip2).
Under Ubuntu these binaries are downloaded by "sudo hets -update".

To obtain hets under Ubuntu issue:
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:hets/hets
  sudo apt-add-repository -s \
    "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/hets/hets/ubuntu trusty main
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get build-dep hets # to get tools to build hets yourself
  sudo apt-get install hets   # to get the hets packages and dependencies

Examples for testing can be obtained from
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/cofi/Libraries/lib.tgz
Try out i.e. "hets -g Basic/Numbers.casl" to see if the graphical interface
pops up. If this does not work, maybe "uDrawGraph" (Version 3.1.1) from
http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph
is not properly installed.  Make sure "uDrawGraph" can be found in your PATH.

(Under Ubuntu uDrawGraph is a dependency and the libraries can be found under
/usr/lib/hets/hets-lib.)

Source releases (created by "make release" and not needed under Ubuntu)
contain generated sources that should not be changed manually. Some
files are generated by tools (i.e. like "DrIFT"); these utilities are
also Haskell programs.  A source release already contains html
documentation of our modules. In order to generate the documentation
from svn sources you'll need "haddock" that comes with ghc.

Note also that the Makefile in a source release differs from the
Makefile obtained via svn. For a release the ReleaseMakefile
overwrites the Makefile from svn. The original Makefile is renamed
to Makefile.orig.
